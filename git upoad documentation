Another documentation..... but this is related to uploading the project folder on github

First step was the I followed this videos tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oh3N_MvU1LI
The commands include:
1) First open the folder you wanna upload in terminal
2) git init
3) git remote add origin "gitlink"
4) git remote -v
5) git add .
6) git commit -m "comment"
7) git push origin master

But after step 3 I get an error: remote origin already exists.

so I find that the older project file is already in origin so I go to stackoverflow and get perfect solution:
git remote rm origin
git remote add origin git@github.com:username/myapp.git

First I removed the old origin then I ran step 3 again

After running step 4, I found there is an unwanted 'origin-master' remote also existing which I created because I didn't know how to deal with the error after step 3 in vscode
So I remove that origin-master origin also

Then I ran step 5 and then step 6
I get this:
Author identity unknown

*** Please tell me who you are.

Run

  git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"
 
 So I ran both the codes by entering my email and name
 
 After that I ran step 6 again and then all my project files path is printed but it also shows: 411 files changed, 187 insertions(+), 97 deletions(-)
Which is kinda sus, coz it should be taking it as an independent project folder on my system not some modified one.

Anyhow I ignore it and run step 7
I enter my username and password for authentication, but it gives authentication failed
So then I learn again from stackoverflow that I have to generate a personal access token and use that instead of password like so:
From your GitHub account, go to Settings → Developer Settings → Personal Access Token → Tokens (classic) → Generate New Token (Give your password) → Fillup the form → click Generate token → Copy the generated Token, it will be something like ghp_sFhFsSHhTzMDreGRLjmks4Tzuzgthdvfsrta

Now everything looks fine, but when I go to my github to check if the files are that as per the video tutorial, I get a page with this message:
There isn't anything to compare. Nothing to compare, branches are entirely different commit histories
and below are all my files that are "changed"
And no matter what I tried it didn't exactly upload

Thankfully this video tutorial saved me: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quxpa1P5BHs&t=2s
The only thing I had to change was that the guy had his "master" named new-feature
So I practically ran it like so:
git checkout master
git branch main master -f
git checkout main
git push origin main -f

Again it asked for my username and password, where I provided the same PAT

Then Voila! everything was successfully uploaded to my github repository
